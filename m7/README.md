# welcome

##First GIT project AWS2 M8

In this project you simply have to add 2 files for each student. One 
for a picture of you (or whatever avatar you like) and a presentation 
in HTML of you.

You are welcome to add any improvements to the PHP code if you feel 
like doing it.

## Folders and filenames

- `img` folder : your picture in JPG format. The filename will be used to 
display your name. Choose it appropriately.
- `profile` folder : your presentation in HTML. Same for the 
*filename* (must be according to your picture).


> IMPORTANT NOTE: **anyone who overwrites another person's file will be 
qualified with ZERO** '0' in this task. So, please be nice.


And if you want to add some more presentation here in the README file, 
you may take a look to the [Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/).
